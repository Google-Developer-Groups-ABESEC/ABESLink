# ABESLink 🚀

Auto-login app for ABES Engineering College campus WiFi. No more captive portal headaches!

## What's This?

Tired of logging into the campus WiFi every single time? Yeah, we felt that. ABESLink automatically handles the captive portal authentication so you can focus on what matters.

Built by students, for students at ABES Engineering College.

## Features

- **Auto-Login**: Detects captive portal and logs you in automatically
- **One-Time Setup**: Save your credentials once, forget about it
- **Background Service**: Keeps monitoring network changes (optional)
- **Dark Mode**: Because your eyes matter
- **Secure Storage**: Credentials encrypted locally on your device
- **Network Probing**: Configurable intervals to check connection status
- **Activity Logs**: See your recent login attempts and their status
